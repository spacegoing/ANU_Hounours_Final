COVER LETTER FOR LEARNING WEIGHTED LOWER LINEAR ENVELOPE POTENTIALS IN
                BINARY PAIRWISE MARKOV RANDOM FIELDS

Dear Editors,

Please accept our paper "Learning Weighted Lower Linear Envelope
Potentials in Binary Markov Random Fields" for review in the TPAMI
special issue on "Higher Order Graphical Models in Computer Vision:
Modelling, Inference, and Learning." Our paper is an extension of a
previous ICML conference paper. We have made the following additional
contributions:

  1. We have introduced a per-variable weight w_i and shown explicitly
  how to define models, perform inference, and learn parameters on
  lower linear envelope potentials that include these weights.

  2. We have added Lemma 3.1 that states that we can set b_1 = 0
  without loss of generality.

  3. We have added Lemma 3.2 that shows that the constraints on z_k
  introduced in our previous conference paper are not required.

  4. The appendix provides a proof that the max-margin learning
  algorithm with \epslion > 0 will converge in a polynomial number of
  iterations.

  5. Experiments on the synthetic data have been added comparing the
  different formulations of the problem.

  6. Experiments on the Weizmann horse dataset have been added.

  7. Much of the text has been expanded and additional technical
  details added.

Kind Regards,
